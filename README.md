# Graphv

## Overview

Port of the [NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg) C library to (mostly) pure OCaml. This library is still a work in progress, the documentation is not complete and there could be more examples. Some context flags are also not passed down to the backend renderer yet.

## Docs

Docs can be found [here](https://wlitwin.github.io/docs/graphv/graphv). They are still a work in progress.

## Screenshots

## Demo

A live web demo can be found [here](https://wlitwin.github.io/demos/graphv). If the fonts look wrong the first time, refresh.

Performance varies quite a lot between browsers, Chrome tends to be the fastest. The demo supports mouse and touch events. Clicking/tapping will zoom the top-left widget, hovering the text will highlight rows, and two fingers on mobile will allow zooming/panning. Dragging a single finger on mobile will make the eyes follow the finger.

## Performance

Below is a table of eye-ball measurements of frame times across platforms compared with the native C implementation of NanoVG. All times are in millseconds (ms). Measurements were taken on a MacBook Pro Late 2013 laptop.

| Platform      | OCaml         | NanoVG (GLES2) | NanoVG JS   |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ---------   |
| Linux Native  | 1.05 +/- 0.5  | 1.00 +/- 0.5   |  N/A        |
| Linux Chrome  | 5.50 +/- 2    | N/A            |  5.50 +/- 2 |
| Linux Firefox | 12.00 +/ 5    | N/A            |  8.00 +/- 2 |
